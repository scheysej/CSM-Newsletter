        <h1>My Missions Trip in Chicago</h1>
        <p>Reflections on my 2-month journey this summer</p>
    </header>
    <article>
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>WOW!!! What a summer it has been! After so much hesitation and deliberation, I decided to take 2 months
                of my summer to dedicate to a missions trip in Chicago.
                Alongside 43 other amazing students and a fair number of Cru staff, we shared the gospel message, fed
                and prayed for those in need, and
                overall just cared for people in Chicago whether we knew
                them or not. <br><br> It was such a blessing to be able to go on this trip. God worked in so many many
                ways,
                both in us and those around us. When there is a greenhouse of growth
                it's hard to miss how drastic someone can change in just 2 months, myself included. I am so glad I said
                yes to this, because I would have missed out on so many things God wanted to do in my life!

                <br><br>
                Below is a
                synopsis
                of what happened during the trip!!
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Week 1: Arrival and First Impressions</h2>
            <p> We started off with all 44 students (myself included) arriving to our apartment complex. I knew a total
                of 2 people going into this trip, so being slightly introverted, it's safe to say that I was very
                intimidated and worried about how this would go. They had everyone get to know each other with a speed
                friending game, then sent everyone to do some bonding questions with their roommates (mine are pictured
                below).<br><br>
                This first week was mainly just getting acclimated to all the people, the groups (like which folks were
                in your Bible study), and the city itself (and how to use public transportation). There was a lot of
                information thrown at us in such a short period of time, but not once did I ever feel out of place or
                uncomfortable. The Lord gave me a peace that I could never make sense of, but it was something that I
                probably couldn't have done without.<br><br>
                This week also consisted of me settling into my work. I ended up working on two programming project
                through University of Detroit Mercy.
                I did this so that I could work remotely and get used to the lifestyle that would bring me. This led to
                me finding coffee shops to work at and my
                all time favorite spot the University of Illinois Chicago library. I worked on these projects Monday,
                Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday until the evenings.
                The evenings are for Cru events: training, community events, outreach (which I took off work for on
                Thursdays), and night with the Lord.

            <h2>Week 2-4</h2>
            <p>
                This time was filled with learning and practicing. The Cru staff were pouring into us emotionally,
                spiritually, intellectually, and physically trying to ensure that we were as prepared as possible to
                take their place. The first month had huge emphasis on preparation and it certainly did prepare! One of
                the biggest struggles I faced in this month was setting aside the UofM vs. OSU rivalry and by doing that
                I made several life long friends that are just as passionate about following God's will for their lives
                as I was.

            <h2>The Students Take Over</h2>
            <p>
                The staff left. Seemingly entrusting the entirety of the mission to 44 college students that had no
                idea what they were doing. When in reality, they left, entrusting 44 college students that trusted God
                and were actually excited to take over and freely give everything we had to God for the next month. This
                was one of the most bizzarre experiences of my entire life. In this month I watched people I met a month
                ago become a family, as we loved, ate with, cried with, struggled with, disagreed with, prayed with, and
                trusted eachother. This was one of the most God-centered communities I have ever been a part of.
                Everyone was
                assigned their role to take over and each person stepped into it ready to see how God wanted to use
                them. The most powerful part of this, was watching people acknowledge their roles and decide to lead by
                serving... the way Jesus taught us to. It felt like the staff were holding us back, because after they
                left it felt like an explosion went off. Now that I think about it, they were just preparing us and
                pouring fuel on that flame, so that when they left we would all be ignited again to make it our own and
                listen to how God wants us to do his work in Chicago.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This trip was a once in a lifetime experience. I made many lifelong friends, grew in almost every aspect
                (spiritually, emotionally, intellectually, relationally, etc.), and learned what it truly means to share
                the gospel with others. Instead of pushing our beliefs down poeple's throats, we focused on connection
                and SHOWING them what a God-Centered community looks like and then inviting them to join us. Yes we did
                share the gospel, but our focus was on having a conversation, while guided, showed people that we were
                genuinely interested in their stories.

            <h3>The Stats</h3>
            While the numbers for something like this are not important, I am a nerd, so I think the numbers are cool. I
            also want to preface that these numbers could never come close to reflecting how many people were actually
            reached, these are just the people that we directly interacted with (and the ones that our students actually
            filled out the conversation survey for)
            <br><br>
            Initiations (how many people did we initiate conversations with): 1090
            <br><br>
            Spiritual Conversations (with how many people did our conversations involve spiritual topics): 587
            <br><br>
            Gospel Conversations (with how many people did our conversatiosn turn into talking about the gospel): 272
            <br><br>
            Decisions for Christ (pretty self explanatory): 14
            <br><br>
            Countries Reached (chicago has a lot of tourism): 50

            <h3> Cool Stories </h3>
            <i>"Therefore my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully
                to the work of the Lord, for you know that your labor in him is not in vain" - 1 Corinthians 15:58</i>
            <br><br>
            We stayed at Tailor Loft Apartments, which had front desk security 24/7. We got to know each of the front
            desk workers very well in 8.5 weeks, to the point that it sucked saying goodbye to them as well. However
            there were two specific interactions with them that I want to highlight.
            <br><br>
            First being with the front
            desk worker, Tony. Our group just got done with our Ice Cream Social that we invited the entire Lofts to and
            also everyone we met during outreach. I was headed up to my room to do some quiet time before bed, when Tony
            calls out "Hey, are you guys going to clean up in there?". I turned and said "Of course! We have people
            assigned to clean up, so don't worry we won't leave a mess". He then added after looking at the cameras
            "Would you look at that, they are already getting started. I was never worried, I know you guys, you are
            really responsible and we love having you here.". At this point I had gone over to the desk and we talked
            for a good 30 minutes. In that conversation he said something along the lines of "Your group is so different
            than all the other college students I experience. You are always so happy and laughing together." I took
            that as an opportunity to let him know that it was because of God that we can be like that. Which led to
            Tony and me trading stories about the different ways we have seen/experienced God working in our lives.

            <br><br>
            The second being with the front desk worker named Marquis. From week 1 I would always greet him with a fist
            bump and everytime our group came by a smile would come to his face. He always enjoyed talking to our group
            and he would ask a lot of questions. However, whenever we tried to guide the conversation towards faith or
            the gospel, he would start to shut it down. God worked so much in him that in the last two weeks he started
            asking questions about Christianity and about what we were doing in Chicago. I found out that he was muslim,
            but that he didn't really feel like he was "vibing" with it for lack of better terms. I was more than happy
            to talk to him about our group, what we believe, and what / why we were doing in Chicago.

            <br><br>
            One of the other really neat ways I saw God work was when my friend, Colton, and I were walking to our
            Wednesday community event. I had asked Colton how outreach went that day and in his resonse he was saying
            "Jesus" a lot. This lady had at some point been walking in the same direction as our group and I saw her
            look back at us, smile, and then just shake her head. I thought she was thinking "Oh, more of these
            Christian people again", and was a little unsettled at her display of disapproval. Then we stopped at a
            crosswalk and she turns back to us and says "I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just got off work. I have had a
            really long day, and I was looking forward to going home and doing nothing for the rest of the evening. My
            church is in their 'Holy Spirit' week, and I would typically go but I just feel so exhausted. So I prayed to
            God asking him to *in an exaggerated manner* give me a sign. As soon as I said Amen to that prayer, you guys
            started talking. I was like 'Okay God... FINE, I get it'". So then she thanked us for allowing God to use us
            even though we didn't know how it would happen, and she turned off to go to church.

            <br><br>
            I could go on for awhile about all of the really cool ways God worked in Chicago. But I don't think I would
            ever get around to sending this out to people if I did that. So if you are interested in hearing more about
            that or just have questions about my trip text me at <b>(734) 635-1084</b>
